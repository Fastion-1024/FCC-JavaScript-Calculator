## Future Updates and ToDo List

# Improvements

-   Add keyboard shortcuts to history memory toggle, delete all buttons and memory +, -, clear for memory items.
-   Separate the reducers for memory and history from the current global reducer.
-   Rewrite history and memory components. Create new list component and instead make history and memory components items for the list components. This should help consolidate styling between the two.
-   Adjust font size for display and history/memory items based on width up until a certain point.
-   Introduce a Limit to the calculator. Possibly based on width of fontsize against container of display.
-   Allow use of x instead of \* and divide symbol instead of /
